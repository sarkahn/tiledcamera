#### Tiled Camera

A simple utility for pixel/grid based games. Uses Unity's PixelPerfectCamera to resize the viewport according to the desired tile size and count.

You can set the tile size and number of tiles in the TiledCamera inspector and the viewport will be adjusted accordingly. You can also set the color that the area outside the viewport will be cleared to.
